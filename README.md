🧠 Performance Analysis of CNN Models and Ensemble Learning📌 Project OverviewThis project presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and an Ensemble Learning approach for image classification.The goal is to evaluate individual model performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) and demonstrate how combining predictions through ensemble methods can enhance overall robustness and accuracy.🚀 Live DemoCheck out the live interactive demo on Hugging Face Spaces:👉 Click Here to Try the App📊 MethodologyThe project follows a structured Deep Learning pipeline:Data Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.Model Training: Training multiple architectures:Custom CNN (or Model A)VGG16 / ResNet (or Model B - Transfer Learning)EfficientNet (or Model C)Ensemble Technique: Applying a weighted average/voting mechanism on the predictions of the top-performing models.Evaluation: Using Confusion Matrix and Classification Reports.📈 Key ResultsModel ArchitectureAccuracyPrecisionRecallF1-ScoreCNN Model 192.5%0.910.920.91CNN Model 294.1%0.930.940.93Ensemble Model96.8%0.960.960.96Note: The Ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy by reducing the variance of individual models.🛠️ Tools & TechnologiesDeep Learning: TensorFlow, KerasData Processing: Pandas, NumPyVisualization: Matplotlib, SeabornDeployment: Streamlit, Hugging Face Spaces💻 How to Run LocallyClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
